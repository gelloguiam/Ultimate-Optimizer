	"projectDetails" : "The MMORS is one of the dirtiest river systems in the world, as tagged by Blacksmith Institute in 2007 in a
report called as 'Dirty 30'. Years later, after government impunity of industrial polluters, the problems of the
river system still persists. Different non-government organizations such as Pure Earth (formerly Blacksmith
Institute) are doing ways to mitigate river wastes and therefore, further damage from the industries
surrounding the river system.
Another important thing to mention is that the MMORS is also has a river delta (river mouth) directly
connecting to the Manila Bay. Therefore, all effluents (or waste products) coming from the site will also be
received by the Manila Bay and its communities. Most of the people in the area, especially in Navotas and
Valenzuela in the National Capital Region, are involved in catching fish products (especially tilapia) in the
area."
